# SOC Co-Pilot

SOC Co-Pilot is an AI-powered threat detection and response assistant designed to support Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts. This project integrates advanced log analysis, natural language processing, and MITRE ATT&CK-based enrichment to provide human-readable summaries and actionable recommendations for security alerts.

Built using Wazuh, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, and Ollama (Phi-3), SOC Co-Pilot bridges the gap between raw security logs and analyst-ready insights. It enhances situational awareness, speeds up triage, and promotes more consistent and informed decision-making within the SOC.

## Course Information

This is our demo for the course **SPR888 in IFS at Seneca College**. This Docker container represents a mock example of how we envision our capstone idea functioning.

## How to Install Wazuh (Outside Docker)

> Wazuh must be installed on the **host system**, outside the Docker environment. SOC Co-Pilot listens for alerts from this external Wazuh deployment.

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Download the Wazuh installation assistant
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh

# Run the script to install Wazuh components (indexer, server, dashboard)
sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```

After the installation completes, save the following:

- Wazuh Dashboard URL (e.g., `https://<your-server-ip>`)
- Default admin username
- Randomly generated password

## How to Set Up SOC Co-Pilot (Docker-Based)

You can create and run the following script on your **Ubuntu host machine** to install Docker, Ollama, and launch SOC Co-Pilot.

### Save the following as `setup-soc-copilot.sh`:

\`\`\`bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "[*] Updating system..."
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

echo "[*] Installing Docker and Docker Compose..."
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose

echo "[*] Enabling and starting Docker service..."
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

echo "[*] Installing Ollama..."
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

echo "[*] Starting Ollama in background..."
ollama serve &

echo "[*] Pulling Phi-3 Mini model..."
ollama pull phi3:mini

echo "[*] Cloning SOC Co-Pilot repository..."
git clone https://github.com/shirsi3/soc-copilot.git
cd soc-copilot

echo "[*] Starting Docker containers..."
docker compose up -d

echo "[*] Optional: Testing Ollama API..."
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "phi3:mini",
  "prompt": "Explain zero trust in cybersecurity.",
  "stream": false
}'

echo "[*] Setup complete."
\`\`\`

### Make it executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x setup-soc-copilot.sh
./setup-soc-copilot.sh
```

---

## Starting and Monitoring SOC Co-Pilot

### Start All Containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Check Logs for All Containers

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

### Check Logs for a Specific Container

```bash
docker compose logs -f soc-copilot-backend
```

Replace `soc-copilot-backend` with:
- `soc-copilot-worker`
- `soc-copilot-frontend`
- `ollama`
- `postgres`

## Access Points

After setup, you can access the system using the following URLs:

| Component              | URL                              | Description                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| SOC Co-Pilot Dashboard | http://localhost:8080             | Web interface for viewing enriched alerts         |
| FastAPI Swagger Docs   | http://localhost:8000/docs        | API documentation interface                       |
| FastAPI Alert API      | http://localhost:8000/alerts      | Raw JSON response of enriched alerts              |
| Ollama API             | http://localhost:11434            | AI model REST API                                 |
| Wazuh Dashboard        | https://<your-wazuh-server-ip>    | Wazuh dashboard (outside Docker)                  |

> Replace `localhost` with your VMâ€™s IP address if accessing from another machine.
